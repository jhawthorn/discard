Soft deletes for ActiveRecord done right.

## What does this do?

A simple ActiveRecord mixin to add conventions for flagging records as discarded.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'discard', '~> 1.0'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

**Declare a record as discardable**

Declare the record as being discardable

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Discard::Model
end
```


``` ruby
class AddDiscardToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def up
    add_column :posts, :discarded_at, :datetime
    add_index :posts, :discarded_at
  end
end
```


**Discard a record**

```
Post.all             # => [#<Post id: 1, ...>]
Post.kept            # => [#<Post id: 1, ...>]
Post.discarded       # => []

post = Post.first   # => #<Post id: 1, ...>
post.discard        # => true
post.discarded?     # => true
post.discarded_at   # => 2017-04-18 18:49:49 -0700

Post.all             # => [#<Post id: 1, ...>]
Post.kept            # => []
Post.discarded       # => [#<Post id: 1, ...>]
```

**From a controller**

Controller actions need a small modification to discard records instead of deleting them. Just replace `destroy` with `discard`.

``` ruby
def destroy
  @post.discard
  redirect_to users_url, notice: "Post removed"
end
```


**Undiscard a record**

```
post = Post.first   # => #<Post id: 1, ...>
post.undiscard      # => true
```

***From a controller***

```
def update
  @post.undiscard
  redirect_to users_url, notice: "Post undiscarded"
end
```

**Working with associations**

Under paranoia, soft deleting a record will destroy any `dependent: :destroy`
associations. Probably not what you want! This leads to all dependent records
also needing to be `acts_as_paranoid`, which makes restoring awkward: paranoia
handles this by restoring any records which have their deleted_at set to a
similar timestamp. Also, it doesn't always make sense to mark these records as
deleted, it depends on the application.

A better approach is to simply mark the one record as discarded, and use SQL
joins to restrict finding these if that's desired.

For example, in a blog comment system, with `Post`s and `Comment`s, you might
want to discard the records independently. A user's comment history could
include comments on deleted posts.

``` ruby
Post.kept # SELECT * FROM posts WHERE discarded_at IS NULL
Comment.kept # SELECT * FROM comments WHERE discarded_at IS NULL
```

Or you could decide that comments are dependent on their posts not being
discarded. Just override the `kept` scope on the Comment model.

``` ruby
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts

  include Discard::Model
  scope :kept, -> { undiscarded.joins(:posts).merge(Post.kept) }
end

Comment.kept
# SELECT * FROM comments
#    INNER JOIN posts ON comments.post_id = posts.id
# WHERE
#    comments.discarded_at IS NULL AND
#       posts.discarded_at IS NULL
```

SQL databases are very good at this, and performance should not be an issue.

In both of these cases restoring either of these records will do right thing!


**Default scope**

It's usually undesirable to add a default scope. It will take more effort to
work around and will cause more headaches. If you know you need a default scope, it's easy to add yourself ‚ù§.

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Discard::Model
  default_scope -> { kept }
end

Post.all                       # Only kept posts
Post.with_discarded            # All Posts
Post.with_discarded.discarded  # Only discarded posts
```

**Custom column**

If you're migrating from paranoia, you might want to continue using the same
column.

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Discard::Model
  self.discard_column = :deleted_at
end
```

**Callbacks**

Callbacks can be run before, after, or around the discard and undiscard operations.
A likely use is discarding or deleting associated records (but see "Working with associations" for an alternative).

``` ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Discard::Model

  has_many :comments

  after_discard do
    comments.discard_all
  end

  after_undiscard do
    comments.undiscard_all
  end
end
```

**Working with Devise**

A common use case is to apply discard to a User record. Even though a user has been discarded they can still login and continue their session.
If you are using Devise and wish for discarded users to be unable to login and stop their session you can override Devise's method.

```
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  def active_for_authentication?
    super && !discarded_at
  end
end
```

## Non-features

* Special handling of AR counter cache columns - The counter cache counts the total number of records, both kept and discarded.
* Recursive discards (like AR's dependent: destroy) - This can be avoided using queries (See "Working with associations") or emulated using callbacks.
* Recursive restores - This concept is fundamentally broken, but not necessary if the recursive discards are avoided.

## Why not paranoia or acts_as_paranoid?

I've worked with and have helped maintain
[paranoia](https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia) for a while. I'm convinced
it does the wrong thing for most cases.

Paranoia and
[acts_as_paranoid](https://github.com/ActsAsParanoid/acts_as_paranoid) both
attempt to emulate deletes by setting a column and adding a default scope on the
model. This requires some ActiveRecord hackery, and leads to some surprising
and awkward behaviour.

* A default scope is added to hide soft-deleted records, which necessitates
  adding `.with_deleted` to associations or anywhere soft-deleted records
  should be found. :disappointed:
  * Adding `belongs_to :child, -> { with_deleted }` helps, but doesn't work for joins and eager-loading in older version of rails (See [detail](https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia/issues/355#issuecomment-315770435))

* `delete` is overridden (`really_delete` will actually delete the record) :unamused:
* `destroy` is overridden (`really_destroy` will actually delete the record) :pensive:
* `dependent: :destroy` associations are deleted when performing soft-destroys :scream:
  * requiring any dependent records to also be `acts_as_paranoid` to avoid losing data. :grimacing:

There are some use cases where these behaviours make sense: if you really did
want to _almost_ delete the record. More often developers are just looking to
hide some records, or mark them as inactive.

Discard takes a different approach. It doesn't override any ActiveRecord
methods and instead simply provides convenience methods and scopes for
discarding (hiding), restoring, and querying records.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
