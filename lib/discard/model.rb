      # Discards the records by instantiating each
      # record and calling its {#discard} method.
      # Each object's callbacks are executed.
      # Returns the collection of objects that were discarded.
      #
      # Note: Instantiation, callback execution, and update of each
      # record can be time consuming when you're discarding many records at
      # once. It generates at least one SQL +UPDATE+ query per record (or
      # possibly more, to enforce your callbacks). If you want to discard many
      # rows quickly, without concern for their associations or callbacks, use
      # #update_all(discarded_at: Time.current) instead.
